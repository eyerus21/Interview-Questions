/* A fancy number is a number in the sequence 1, 1, 5, 17, 61, â€¦ .Note that first two fancy numbers
are 1 and any fancy number other than the first two is sum of the three times previous one and two
times the one before that. See below:
1,
1,
3*1 +2*1 = 5
3*5 +2*1 = 17
3*17 + 2*5 = 61
Write a function named isFancy that returns 1 if its integer argument is a Fancy number, otherwise it
returns 0. */
