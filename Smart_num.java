/*An integer is defined to be a Smart number if it is an element in the infinite sequence 1, 2, 4, 7, 11,
16 â€¦ Note that 2-1=1, 4-2=2, 7-4=3, 11-7=4, 16-11=5 so for k>1, the kth element of the sequence is
equal to the k-1th element + k-1. For example, for k=6, 16 is the kth element and is equal to 11 (the k-
1th element) + 5 ( k-1).*/
