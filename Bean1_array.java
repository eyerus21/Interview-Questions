/* . A Bean array is defined to be an array where for every value n in the array, there is also an
element n-1 or n+1 in the array.
For example, {2, 10, 9, 3} is a Bean array because 2 = 3-1
10 = 9+1
3 = 2 + 1
9 = 10 -1
Other Bean arrays include {2, 2, 3, 3, 3}, {1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1} and {0, -1, 1}.*/
