/*Write a function named minDistance that returns the smallest distance between two factors of a
number. For example, consider 13013 = 1*7*11*13. Its factors are 1, 7, 11, 13 and 13013.
minDistance(13013) would return 2 because the smallest distance between any two factors is 2 (13 -
11 = 2). As another example, minDistance (8) would return 1 because the factors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, 8
and the smallest distance between any two factors is 1 (2 â€“ 1 = 1).
